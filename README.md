FaceTrack simply allows users to track their lost device. If the owner has set a password for their device, the device can be traceable. If the person who found the device enters the password wrong, the front facing camera will take a picture of the person and send it to the owners email address. It will also send an SMS notification to the next of kin of the ownerâ€™s device. If the device does not have a front facing camera only an SMS notification will be triggered. The text message will have a link that will locate the missing device on Google Maps.
